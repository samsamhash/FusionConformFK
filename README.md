# FusionConformFK
Fusion of Conform and Feynman-Kac (FK) steering and manipulation of latents. Base code is from https://github.com/zacharyhorvitz/Fk-Diffusion-Steering and https://github.com/gemlab-vt/CONFORM
<br/>
Repository with code of the three different cases to be tested in a free account in google colab, just run all the instalations cells first and then you can continue with the tests:
- Fusion_Standar / Its the playground set to test the generation using Conform and Feynman-Kac steering.
- Fusion_LCM / Its the version to test using Latent Consistency Models, dreamshaper-7 for faster generation.
- Fusion_Latent / Its the fusion also using the initial latents from an image to modificate and improve it.
- FusionFK-Conform / PDF with a brief explanation.
